# MediaTracker


My first home project! A simple web application to track media watching.
The MediaTracker is written for Python 3.5.

## Requirements
idk, works on my local ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯

## Current functionality:

- Add series/films to list
- Give series some episodes
- Track progress through series
- Tag series
